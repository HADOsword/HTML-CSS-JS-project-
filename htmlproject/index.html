                <h3>Moroccan starters</h3>
                <p><strong>Usually served at the beginning of meals, Moroccan starters are presented as an accompaniment to main dishes. They vary from one region to another, but generally consist of a Moroccan salad of either raw or cooked vegetables, Briouates stuffed with chicken or minced meat, a ratatouille of peppers and tomatoes - the so-called Tektouta - and the famous Zaâlouk which is an eggplant puree. Each recipe has a special seasoning, and brings out its own flavour and colour.</strong></p>
